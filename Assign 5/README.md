# 📝 Assignment 5: JavaScript Programming Basics

This assignment demonstrates fundamental **JavaScript concepts** through practical coding tasks in Node.js and the browser: taking user input, working with arrays, objects, forms, and array methods.

***

## 📑 Tasks Included

### i. Arithmetic Operations on Two Numbers

- **Description:**  
  Prompts the user for two numbers and displays their sum, difference, product, and quotient.  
  - Runs on Node.js using `readline` (see `1.js`)
  
***

### ii. Array Manipulation

- **Description:**  
  Creates an array of 5 numbers and:
  - Finds the largest and smallest
  - Sorts in ascending and descending order  
  - Uses spread operator and sort method (see `2.js`)

***

### iii. Form Validation (HTML + JS)

- **Description:**  
  Simple HTML form with name, email, and age fields. JavaScript validates that:
  - Name is not empty
  - Email is in the correct format
  - Age is between 18 and 100  
  - (See `3.html` for the implementation)

***

### iv. Student Object Operations

- **Description:**  
  Defines a student object with properties (`name`, `age`, `grade`). The program:
  - Adds a new property (`class`)
  - Updates grade
  - Displays student info  
  - (See `4.js`)

***

### v. Array Methods Practice

- **Description:**  
  Function that takes an array of numbers and:
  - Removes odd numbers
  - Multiplies remaining by 2
  - Finds the sum of the resulting numbers  
  - Uses `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()` (see `5.js`)

***

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js** – Used for console input and output
- **JavaScript (ES6 features)** – Array/object manipulation, form validation
- **HTML (for form)**

## 🚀 How to Run

1. For JavaScript files:
   - Run with Node.js:  
     ```bash
     node 1.js
     node 2.js
     node 4.js
     node 5.js
     ```
2. For the form validation:
   - Open `3.html` in any modern web browser.
